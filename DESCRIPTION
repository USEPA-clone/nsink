Description: N-Sink is an analysis that utilizes geospatial data to estimate a 
             flow path and the nitrogen removal along that flow path.  
             Additionally, several static maps summarizing nitrogen removal may 
             be summarized.  The nsink package provides tools to setup and run 
             this analysis for any HUC in the united states.
