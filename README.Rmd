The `nsink` package is an R implementation of the methods described in [Kellogg et. al (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.02.006).  Previous implementation of this approach relied on a vector based approach that was time consuming to prepare.  This approach uses a hybrid raster-vector approach that takes very little time to set up for each new watershed and relies on readily available data.  Thus, its application is national for the United States.

Proposed (as of `r lubridate::today()`) functions for the `nsink` package are:

- `nsink_get_data()` - Pass HUC, get data, use cache to avoid repeat downloads
- `nsink_prep_data()` - Prepares data by clipping to specified HUC, standardizing projections, standardizing raster extents.  Outputs will be HUC level for HUC, flow direction, streams, waterbodies, impervious, and soils. 
- `nsink_calc_removal()` - implemented now as purely raster, might be able to do hybrid approach (see lines 384+ in working_nsink.Rmd).  Use a method argument for c("raster", "hybrid").  
  - `nsink_calc_land_removal()`
  - `nsink_calc_stream_removal()`
  - `nsink_calc_lake_removal()`
  - `nsink_calc_removal_type()` - maybe include this as part of each type removal
- `nsink_calc_flowpath()`
  - `nsink_flowpath_ends()`
  - `nsink_flowpath_flowlines()`
  - `nsink_flowpath_removal_filter()` - raster only.
- `nsink_summarize_flowpath_removal()` - summarizes flowpath removal

The API for this package is still very much a work in progress and may change at anytime with possible breakage of past functionality.  Use at own risk!
