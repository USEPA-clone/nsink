The `nsink` package is an R implementation of the methods described in [Kellogg et. al (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.02.006).  Previous implementation of this approach relied on a vector based approach that was time consuming to prepare.  This approach uses a hybrid raster-vector approach that takes very little time to set up for each new watershed and relies on readily available data.  Thus, its application is national for the United States.

The package will contain the following functions:

- `nsink_get_data()`
-
