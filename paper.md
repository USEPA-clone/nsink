# Summary

Excess nitrogen (N) delivery via surface water to coastal estuaries 
contributes to impaired water quality evidenced by excess algal blooms 
and hypoxia [@Rabalais:2002]. Identifying landscape N sinks (areas where 
dissolved N is transformed to gaseous N and effectively removed from 
the aquatic system) and their effect on N delivery at the watershed 
scale is helpful to watershed managers, land use planners and conservation 
organizations.  The theoretical underpinnings rely on decades of research and 
are explained in @Kellogg:2009. The landscape nitrogen sinks considered in the
NSink approach include wetlands, streams and ponds, which are all areas were 
water flow is slowed and N transformations have time to occur.

The N-Sink package was written to simplify the acquisition and management of the 
spatial data necessary to estimate N removal within each identified landscape sink, estimate cumulative N removal 
along a specified flowpath, and create a set of static watershed maps. 
These static maps include 1) a color-coded map of the estimated N removal 
capacity of the different landscape sinks; 2) a heat map with the 
cumulative N removal along flowpaths originating from a grid of points 
across a watershed, highlighting “leaky” areas with less downstream 
N retention vs. those with higher downstream retention; c) N sources 
based on NLCD categories and expressed as an N index ranging from 0 to 1; 
and d) the result of combining b) and c) showing potential N delivery 
(again, as an index) from different sources, taking into account 
the potential N removal as water moves downstream.
